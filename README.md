# Span
**A minimalist macOS widget to track the passage of time.**

It shows the progress between any two dates (semesters, deadlines, years) with over 100 unique status messages ranging from helpful to existential.

### ⚠️ Installation
*Since I don't pay for an Apple Developer license, macOS will treat this as "Unverified."*

1. Unzip and drag `Progression Widget.app` to your **Applications** folder.
2. **Right-Click** the app -> **Open** -> Click **Open** on the warning.
